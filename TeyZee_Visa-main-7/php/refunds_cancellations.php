    <p>
        At <strong>Teyzee Visas</strong>, we strive to provide high-quality visa assistance and consultation services with complete transparency. Before proceeding with any of our services, we request you to carefully read and understand our refund and cancellation policy.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Non-Refundable Services</h4>
    <p>The following services are strictly non-refundable once the payment has been made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Check Eligibility Fees:</strong> This fee covers initial document review and eligibility assessment. Due to the nature of the service, it is non-refundable once the review process has begun.</li>

        <li><strong>2. Visa Processing Charges:</strong> These charges include document handling, form filling, appointment scheduling, and application support. Once initiated, the visa processing service cannot be reversed or refunded.</li>

        <li><strong>3. Consulate/Embassy Fees:</strong> These are government-imposed fees paid directly to embassies or consulates. These payments are non-refundable under any circumstances as per embassy/consulate policies. In msot cases, these are paid to the Consulate directly by the traveler, so we do not need to collect or refund the fee. In case of part payment to Consulate, it is entirely non-refiundable. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Cancellations</h4>
    <p>
        If you decide to cancel the service after making a payment, no refund will be issued for any of the services mentioned above. We advise our customers to be certain before initiating payment and proceeding with our services.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Exceptions</h4>
    <p>
        Refunds will only be considered in rare cases of duplicate payment made in error, and only after verification by our accounts team. Such requests must be made within 7 days of the transaction with valid proof.
